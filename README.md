# Lanskern ByteCode C Compiler or simply LBCC

LBCC is a C compiler written in C that compiles C to [LanCode Assembly](https://github.com/HelleBenjamin/LanVM/blob/main/ISA.md). 

Currently LBCC supports only a small subset of C. It is a work in progress and is not intended to be a full-fledged C compiler. LBCC is a fork of 9cc and uses the same license as 9cc. To learn more about the compiler check out the original [9cc](https://github.com/rui314/9cc) project.

## What is LanCode and LanVM?
[LanVM](https://github.com/HelleBenjamin/LanVM) is a virtual machine with a custom 16-bit ISA. LanCode is the assembly language for LanVM, and is inspired by x86 and RISC assembly languages.

## License

LBCC is released under the [MIT](LICENSE) license.
